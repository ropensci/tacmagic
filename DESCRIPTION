Description: To faciliate analysis of positron emission tomography (PET) time
    activity curve (TAC) data, and to encourage open science and replicability,
    this package supports data loading and analysis of multiple TAC file 
    formats. Functions are available to analyze loaded tac data for individual 
    participants or in batches. Major functionality includes weighted TAC 
    merging by region of interest (ROI), calculating models including SUVR and
    DVR, basic plotting functions and calculation of cut-off values. Please see
    the walkthrough vignette for a detailed overview of tacmagic functions.
